        <p>
          We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.

        <p>
          The photo you provide for verification is processed to create a unique, non-reversible digital signature (embedding). We do not store the photo itself. This signature is used solely to ensure that each user has only one account and to prevent fraudulent activity. This data is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with any third parties.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground self-start pt-4">3. Data Retention</h2>
